# Unfriendly Error Message in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common issue in MATLAB: unhelpful error messages when functions encounter unexpected inputs. The `bug.m` file shows a function that throws a generic error without clear guidance on how to fix it. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.m`, demonstrates better error handling with more informative messages.
